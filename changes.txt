  Refactored all demos to use the new functionalities.

  ----
  Added (base-url) which determines the application base url from the request.

2008-01-26:

  sql.clj:
  Added (update con update-clause ...update-args...).
  Added (with-tx con func) with commit on success and rollback on SQLException.

  ----
  Added automagic handler definition macro (defh url request-bindings options ...body...).
  url is the url-pattern to publish the handler to.
  request-bindings is a sequence as defined by request-bind.
  options is a map of options (may be nil), currently only supported is {:type :html} which
  automagically send the last evaluated value of body as an html output (see html-format)
  
  ----
  Added ability to call application init fn when WebjureServlet has been initialized.
  The fn is specified as 'init' parameter in the servlet config using the full name (example: webjure-demos/init).

  ----
  Added working version of xmlparse.clj which provides declarative DOM tree parsing and
  value extraction. This is mostly a rewrite of my old JScheme code that did the same (more or less).
  Also a simple atom v1.0 feed parser based on the former (feed.clj). 

  ---- 
  Added (session-get attribute initial-value?) which gets the given attribute value from session.
  If the optional initial-value is provided and the attribute has no value in the session,
  the initial-value is stored in the session and returned.

  ----
  Added (request-bind [bindings] ...body...) which binds GET/POST parameters to variables.
  bindings = binding 
           | binding bindings

  binding = var "name"
          | var {...options...} 
 
  Currently available options are: 
    :name (the request parameter name, required)
    :multiple (if true, the value is returned as a seq)
    :validator (a form which returns a validated value from the request parameter value)

  Removed handler parameters. Instead *request* and *response* globals are bound during 
  handler calls.
