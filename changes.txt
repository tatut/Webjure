  Upgrade to Clojure 1.0.0. Mostly just removed nil punning usage.

2008-11-23:

  Removed evil re-defing of *handlers*. It is now a ref.
  
  defh can now take a regex pattern instead of string.
  If a regular expression matches, it is used before any string matches.

  Added support for binding path components. If the accessor in defh
  if a Number it is considered a regular expression group index.
  You can also use :group key in a map accessor.

  Fixed multiple request parameters bug. 

  Added JSON serialization support. See webjure.json namespace.
  Also supported in defh automagic by using {:output :json} and 
  anything the body returns will be JSONified and sent to the client
  with application/json content type.


2008-11-18:

  Refactored XML parsing and feed support.
  They are now in webjure.xml and webjure.xml.feeds respectively.

  Added an Atom feed test (Clojure news) to demos.

2008-11-17:

  Sync up with Clojure changes. With thanks to Mats-Ola Persson.

2008-10-18:

  Clojure is now one year old!
  Update webjure to work with the latest revision.

  Removed 'require' as it conflicts with clojure. The module functionality
  from clojure should be used instead.

  Organize code to new namespaces: webjure, webjure.sql, webjure.html

  
2008-01-27:

  Refactored all demos to use the new functionalities.

  ----
  Added (base-url) which determines the application base url from the request.

2008-01-26:

  sql.clj:
  Added (update con update-clause ...update-args...).
  Added (with-tx con func) with commit on success and rollback on SQLException.

  ----
  Added automagic handler definition macro (defh url request-bindings options ...body...).
  url is the url-pattern to publish the handler to.
  request-bindings is a sequence as defined by request-bind.
  options is a map of options (may be nil), currently only supported is {:type :html} which
  automagically send the last evaluated value of body as an html output (see html-format)
  
  ----
  Added ability to call application init fn when WebjureServlet has been initialized.
  The fn is specified as 'init' parameter in the servlet config using the full name (example: webjure-demos/init).

  ----
  Added working version of xmlparse.clj which provides declarative DOM tree parsing and
  value extraction. This is mostly a rewrite of my old JScheme code that did the same (more or less).
  Also a simple atom v1.0 feed parser based on the former (feed.clj). 

  ---- 
  Added (session-get attribute initial-value?) which gets the given attribute value from session.
  If the optional initial-value is provided and the attribute has no value in the session,
  the initial-value is stored in the session and returned.

  ----
  Added (request-bind [bindings] ...body...) which binds GET/POST parameters to variables.
  bindings = binding 
           | binding bindings

  binding = var "name"
          | var {...options...} 
 
  Currently available options are: 
    :name (the request parameter name, required)
    :multiple (if true, the value is returned as a seq)
    :validator (a form which returns a validated value from the request parameter value)
   

2008-01-23

  Removed handler parameters. Instead *request* and *response* globals are bound during 
  handler calls.
